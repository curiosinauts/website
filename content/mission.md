We want to provide free online coding lessons, free online coding platform, and free online instructor engagement for the betterment of kids and their future. Note that a good amount of our time will be spent on improving online coding platform. We want to minimze the difficulties some may have by letting kids experice programming with just a browser and internet connection. It's not practical to expect all kids to have a powerful fast computer. Online coding platform will do all the hard work.

## Motivation

I have been very blessed in life. I believe it's time to pay it forward and contribute to the community. I am forever grateful to my wife for being such a wonderful spouse and friend. I dedicate this journey to my wife and children.

## Target Audience

Anyone can take the courses from CuriosityWorks, but the courses will be often designed in a childlike manner to keep children engaged. We don't intend to teach everything there is to know about coding, it will be beginner focused. We may expand to intermediary but that won't be our immediate goal.
