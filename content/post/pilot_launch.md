## 6 months from now

I have been working hard to get this project off the ground. I am planning to start with two students on the first day. Minimum age requirement is 10 but if the students already know basic math then age is not important.


I still haven't decided which language to teach. Possible candidates are
- Python
- Javascript with WebGL
- Lua for coding in Roblox

Each language has its advantages and disadvantages. The main goal is to keep the students engaged and interested.

It will be a short six months with lots of deliverables. I will see you at the finish line.
