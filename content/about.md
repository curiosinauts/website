It's about coding. It's about teaching kids learn to code while having fun. Coding experience can magical if done right. 

## Funding

We are self funded and will be self funded for the near future.

## Personal Story

I was about ten years old when I had my first exposure to computers. The early exposure got me very comfortable with coding. It eventually led to a life time of passion and a career which I still love and enjoy till this day. My parents weren't rich so they couldn't afford to buy me a computer but they had enough money to send me to a computer coding class back in the 80s. It took my parents three more years before they could afford to buy me a computer. I had to go to the computer lab and use the lab's computer to do my coding experiment. Rain, snow, or hot temperature didn't stop me from going.

I felt like I was a rocket scientist when I was coding. I could build something amazing or fail spectaculously. I truely enjoyed being in control of a machine. The beauty of complex logic coming together to create something immense was addictive. You can build a virtual world and many interesting structures in it that you daydream about while quietly sitting alone. A shy quiet kid came out of his shell to talk to strangers because of sheer excitement and passion.

I have been mentoring a college student and an adult in the professional workforce who is still new to the tech industry. They are both intelligent. They both can code for a living. My conversations with them evolve around various topics but one of them is about learning to enjoy coding. I think that if you are going to do this for a living for the next thirty something years or so, why not have fun.

I would like kids to know that coding is fun and magical.

P.S. Here is one of my favorite quotes that describes what I am trying to accomplish.

> "If you wish to build a ship, do not divide the men into teams and send them to the forest to cut wood. Instead, teach them to long for the vast and endless sea."
